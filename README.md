**Why WeatherWolf Exists: The Real Reason**

So, here’s the deal. You’ve probably been through the grind of learning to code—those endless tutorials that start with “Hello, World!” and loops, and before you know it, you’re knee-deep in the boring basics. But let's be real: who has time for that?

Enter WeatherWolf, the Python extension that basically says, “Screw the basics, let’s get to the good stuff.”

Why was WeatherWolf created? Well, let’s just say the developer was sick of getting stuck in tutorial hell, repeating the same beginner stuff over and over. The idea was simple: what if there was a way to skip all that and just start coding like a pro, or at least feel like one? So, they slapped together some code, threw in a cool name (because everything’s better with a cool name), and boom—WeatherWolf was born.

It’s not here to hold your hand or make you feel warm and fuzzy about learning loops for the hundredth time. It’s here to kickstart your coding journey by tossing the “introduction to coding” out the window and fast-tracking you to the stuff that actually matters.

So yeah, that’s WeatherWolf. The Python extension for people who’d rather skip the snooze fest and get straight to the good part. No frills, no fairy tales—just a shortcut past the basics so you can start coding like you mean it.
